**Problem Description:**

We are working on a system that generates captions for images. However, sometimes the system may hallucinate or include objects that are not actually present in the image. These hallucinated objects are detected and marked as false positives (FP) using a special token `$` before the object in the caption. For example, a hallucinated object like "refrigerator" would appear as `$refrigerator`.

The task is to read the caption with the marked FP tokens and remove the hallucinated objects while maintaining the fluency of the text. The goal is to preserve the original context of the image and avoid introducing new objects or altering the intended meaning.

**Main Instructions:**

1. **FP Marked Tokens**: Any hallucinated object in the caption is marked with `$` before it (e.g., `$refrigerator`).

   Example:

   * "The image shows a spacious studio apartment kitchen with wooden cabinets and $refrigerator."

2. **Removing Hallucinated Objects**:

   * If the object can be removed without damaging the text or altering its meaning, just remove it. For example:

     * "The image shows a spacious studio apartment kitchen with wooden cabinets and $refrigerator." → "The image shows a spacious studio apartment kitchen with wooden cabinets."

3. **Minimize Changes**:

   * If removing an object requires rephrasing a sentence, make minimal edits. Avoid removing other objects that were originally described in the caption.

4. **No New Objects**:

   * Do not introduce any new objects or details that are not already present in the image. For example, don’t replace "$refrigerator" with "microwave" or other synonyms unless it’s part of the original caption.

5. **Faithfulness to the Original Caption**:

   * Ensure the output is faithful to the original image description and doesn’t introduce new elements. Edits should be minimal but ensure the caption makes sense without the hallucinated object.

6. **Clarity and Brevity**:

   * Make sure the edited caption is clear and concise. If the removal of a hallucinated object leads to awkward phrasing, make small adjustments to improve clarity.

7. **No Over-Editing**:

   * Do not over-edit. Leave parts of the caption intact if they don't need editing, even if they may seem slightly awkward or redundant.


8. **Output Format**:

   * Provide only the edited caption inside double quotes (`""`). Do not add explanations or any additional text.
